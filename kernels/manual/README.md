# Manual kernels

This folder contains **manual (hand-tuned) kernel examples** that use explicit buffering, synchronization, and pipeline control for maximum performance on supported NPUs.

If you are new to PTO programming, start from the ISA and tutorials first:

- Programming tutorials: `docs/coding/tutorial.md`
- Optimization notes: `docs/coding/opt.md`
- PTO ISA reference: `docs/PTOISA.md`

## Platforms

- `a2a3/`: Manual kernels for Ascend A2/A3 platforms.

## How to run

Each subdirectory is a standalone example with its own build/run instructions. See:

- `kernels/manual/a2a3/README.md`
