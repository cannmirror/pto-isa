# PTO ISA Overview

This page is a high-level overview of the PTO Tile Lib instruction set. For the authoritative reference, use:

- Instruction index: `docs/isa/README.md`
- Shared conventions: `docs/isa/conventions.md`
- PTO IR syntax reference: `docs/ir/PTO-IR.md`
- Source of truth (C++ intrinsics): `include/pto/common/pto_instr.hpp`

The per-instruction reference pages in `docs/isa/` are written against the C++ intrinsic API exposed by `pto::T*` functions and use a shared structure and notation.
