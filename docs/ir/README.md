# PTO IR Ops Guide

This section documents PTO IR operations that are part of the Level-1/Level-2 IR contract but are not ISA instruction entries under `docs/isa/`.

## Scope

- View construction and partitioning operations.
- Tile allocation and address movement operations.
- Kernel-parameter query operations.
- Scalar/tile value access helpers.
- Synchronization primitives available in Level-2.

## Entry points

- Non-ISA PTO IR operations reference: `docs/ir/PTO-IR-ops.md`
- ISA instruction pages (per-op canonical semantics): `docs/isa/README.md`
- PTO-AS grammar: `docs/grammar/PTO-AS.md`
